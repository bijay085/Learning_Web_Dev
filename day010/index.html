    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <p>Enitite is combination of words and symbols to make a symbol which may collide with actucal symbol of code. <br><b>For example :</b> greater than , less than symbols are used for making tags, so we want to display those sysmbols but dont want them to collide we use "&-lt;" and "&-gt;" (without - sign)</p>

    without - sign .
    <li> &-copy -> copyright symbol</li>
    <li> &-nbsp -> Space</li>

    <pre>
        <p>The "pre" tag in HTML is used to define the block of preformatted text which preserves the text spaces, 
            line breaks,
                     tabs, and 
        other formatting characters which are ignored by web browsers. </p>
