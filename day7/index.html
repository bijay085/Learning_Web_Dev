    <h3>Theory</h3>
    <p>
        Id will be only one of a element, no multiple id can be assigned to single element and same id cannot be
        assigned to multiple element.
    </p>
    <p><b>For example </b><br> One person can only have one citizenship number. That assigned number will be of only one
        person it must not repeat. <br>Similarly, class let it red tshirt, red tshirt can be worn by 10 people and 1
        person can also have 5 red tshirt.</p>
